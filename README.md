## Anthracite event manager ##

* what: track and manage all changes and events that can have a business and/or operational impact.  
  (deploys, manual changes, outages, press releases, etc)
* why: to increase operational visibility and collaboration

some use cases:

* changelog for troubleshooting and keeping people informed
* enriching monitoring dashboards with markers and annotation text, for visual interactive analysis
* generating reports of operational outage response metrics (see further down)

## Design goals ##

* do one thing and do it well.  aim for simplicity, flexibility and integration.
* accept and deliver events in various ways and support querying for tags and text (full text search)
* support arbitrary tags, allow events with multiple lines, even rich text and hyperlinks.

## Components ##

* anthracite-web.py is the web app (interface for humans, and HTTP POST event receiver)
* anthracite-compose-submit.sh to interactively compose and submit events from the CLI.
* anthracite-submit-github.sh to send messages with git log from a code checkout
* anthracite-tcp-receiver.py is the TCP receiver (only supports single-line events!)
* an sqlite database is automatically created, it suffices.


## Methods of submitting events ##

* HTTP POST receiver in the web app (so you can use something like curl, see source of anthracite-compose-submit.sh)
* manually, in the web interface
* manually, with the `anthracite-compose-submit.sh` CLI script
* `anthracite-submit-github.sh` goes into a code checkout, generates a nice message with the commits/author info from a given
  commit range, and submits it, along with a given list of tags
* `anthracite-tcp-receiver.py` on TCP port 2005 (for one line events) in `<unix timestamp> [<tag1>[ <tag2>[...]]] -- <description>` format


## Integration ##

* [Timeserieswidget](https://github.com/Dieterbe/timeserieswidget) shows graphite graphs with anthracite's events
* The [Graph-Explorer graphite dashboard](https://github.com/Dieterbe/graph-explorer) uses that.

## Dependencies ##

* python2
* python2-pysqlite
* twisted (only needed for the TCP receiver, which you probably don't want - http receiver is better)


## Installation ##

Install dependencies, and just get a code checkout and initialize all git submodules, like so:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Dieterbe/anthracite.git
```

## Deployment ##

Start the web application and point your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8081/

```
cd <path_to_anthracite>
./anthracite-web.py
```

## About "relevant events" ##

I recommend you submit any event that **has** or **might have** a **relevant** effect on:
* your application behavior
* monitoring itself (for example you fixed a bug in metrics reporting. it shouldn't look like the app behavior changed)
* the business (press coverage, viral videos, etc), because this also affects your app usage and metrics.


## Formats and conventions ##

The format is very loose.  I recommend to use tags for categorisation, and ultimately there'll be full-text search so you don't have to worry too much
about formatting or additional tags, as long as the info is within the event.

However, I recommend to try to use some "standardized" nomenclature, such as 'deploy', 'manual' (for manual changes), 'outage', ...
You can use tags like `author=<person>` but this usually doesn't give any benefit over just tagging `<person>`.


## Operational metrics report ##

![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/Dieterbe/anthracite/master/screenshots/screenshot-opsreport.png)

The event format and its tags are very loose.  However, you can use specific tags to enable the ops reporting:

* give outage related events an identifier key (`20130225_switch_broke`) and tag outage related events like `outage=<key>`.
* add tags like `start`, `detected` (issue noticed) and `resolved` to mark resolution (actual service restoration). TODO metric for 'cause identified'.
* add these tags to existing events (such as code deploys) or create new events to mark the points in time where an outage started,
  got detected, got resolved, or changed impact level (i.e. temporary partial fixes)
* Optional: add a tag like `impact=50`: scale of 0 to 100 to denote the extent to which users are affected during the outage. (100 being full outage for all)
  this helps in assessing the severity of the event but don't obsess over it, it doesn't need to be too accurate.
  note: nothing stops you from using a value like 1000 to mark an unrecoverable loss (i.e. dataloss)

The report will look for these tags and give you a report of your operational metrics: (note that the metrics are not weighted for impact yet)

per event, mean, and total:

* TTF (time to failure)
* TTD (time to detection)
* TTR (time to resolution)

average (TODO per-year)
* Uptime

The [ops metametrics slidedeck](http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/ops-metametrics-the-currency-you-pay-for-change) give you more information.


## TODO ##

* plugins for puppet, chef to automatically submit their relevant events (or logstash filter to create anthracite events from logs)
* auto-update events on web interface to make semi-realtime
* on graphs in dashboards, show timeframs from start to end, and start to "cause found", to "resolved" etc.
* a way to prevent id's from incrementing on every read in sql (read cache?)
* concurrent webserver to make sure all http requests can get served
* better MTBF
